When using StealthChop, the motion should not start with a high frequency,
but the stepper motor has to accelerate softly. A high frequency start and
subsequent stop will lead to:

1. Current regulated up to a high value, as a high back EMF is anticipated.

2. When stopping the motor again (no further pulses) the high current is kept
for some time. This can lead to motor overcurrent and the dnver thus disabling. 

To solve: 
Accelerate the motor slowly. The first and last step pulses of a motion
therefore have to have a higher distance.

The TMC drivers have a step filter (per default enabled by GCONF.8) to cope
with uneven step pulses occurring as bursts of 2-4 steps generated by
software pulse generators, but the filter needs roughly 32 microsteps to
(fully) adapt to the initial velocity of a ramp. 


Follow up questions:

Q: Would it be right to think that the motor supply voltage, motor coil
resistance and motor coil inductance will all affect whether the overcurrent
condition occurs?

A: Yes.


Q: How do VREF and IHOLD_IRUN affect things? e.g. will a lower current setpoint
make it more likely that the over-current condition will be triggered?

A: A higher current setting (as controlled by IRUN and VREF) will make it
more likely to trigger overcurrent detection in case of the fast step pulses.


Q: What register/flag could we read from the UART to find out whether this
overcurrent condition has occurred? e.g. would it be something like the
s2vsa, s2vsb, s2ga or s2gb flags in DRV_STATUS?

A: Correct, a short condition will be signalled in DRV_STATUS and in GSTAT.
